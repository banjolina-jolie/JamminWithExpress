#WeJammin
========

http://wejammin.herokuapp.com

This app allows users record audio using a built-in microphone.  The first track acts as the mother track for all other
tracks to be "jammed on".  So lay down a rhythm... then record a couple leads!  Or record a beatbox then rap over it!<br/>

The tracks are persistent as long as someone doesn't click the [x] button.  Stay tuned for authenticated user profiles
and separate rooms to jam in! Oh ya and it only works with Chrome at the moment...<br/>

This app uses:
<ol>
<li>Matt Diamond's RecorderJS plugin https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs</li>
<li>Express.js</li>
<li>Amazon S3 to store wav files</li>
<li>MongoDB to store meta-data about tracks</li>
</ol><br/>
Feel free to message me with any questions or comments!
